# MultiLidarCameraSync
An attempt to synchronize multi-Lidar and camera system. No gps, no CANbus, no IMU.
Right now it can only do offline data processing. 
The output is used to do 3D detection with lidar and camera.

Finished: A naive version of synchronization with ApproximateTime Policy in messagefilter.  

To Do: Camera-centered multi-lidar synchronization
